# What DryRunSecurity Flags (and What It Doesn't)

DryRunSecurity focuses on **real, exploitable code vulnerabilities**. Understanding what it filters out helps you trust the findings and avoid over-fixing.

## What Gets Filtered OUT (Not Reported)

DryRunSecurity intentionally does NOT report:

### Non-Code Issues
- Outdated dependencies or CVEs in libraries (use dependency scanners for these)
- Language/runtime version issues (e.g., "Go 1.24 has CVE-XXXX")
- Infrastructure or configuration assumptions

### False Positives & Low-Impact Issues
- Vulnerabilities requiring another unproven vulnerability to exist first
- Context-inappropriate findings (XSS in CLI tools, CSRF without browser context, SQLi in NoSQL)
- Theoretical risks without practical exploit paths
- Issues only exploitable by already-authorized users against themselves

### Sensitive Logging False Positives
- Exception/error logging (unless proven to contain secrets or PII)
- ID logging (user IDs, UUIDs, transaction IDs)
- Metadata logging (timestamps, counters, non-sensitive headers)
- Only flags logging of: passwords, API keys, tokens, actual PII

### Developer/Test Context
- Vulnerabilities in test files or test utilities
- Debug endpoints requiring source code access
- Issues requiring repository write access

### Non-Security Nitpicks
- Code style or best practice suggestions
- "Should use X instead of Y" without security impact
- Missing rate limiting without abuse scenario
- Verbose error messages without credential/PII exposure

## What DOES Get Reported

If DryRunSecurity flagged it, it passed rigorous filtering. The finding represents:

- A real vulnerability in application source code
- An exploitable issue with a practical attack path
- Something that requires code changes to fix (not just version bumps)
- A confirmed risk after multiple stages of validation

**Trust the finding.** Your job is to fix it correctly, not to second-guess whether it's real.
